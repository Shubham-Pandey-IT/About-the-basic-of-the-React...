This is the basic of react where we know about the basic
that how we can create an element and pass the element or value inside it...

points to remember.....

createElement is not just create an element/html , it just create an object that appears as an HTML element ,
when we are going to render as root.render(heading)  then, it replace the previous data that is present there..


NODE_MODULES----------------->>>>>>
    node_modules are one of the most important directories in your React project as React requires node_modules to run. The node_modules directory is where all the dependancies packages are stored that are used to build and run your react project.
